# Banshee
A Warcraft 3 Game emulator, inspired by GHost++, Made in C#. Pretty Simple

# Current State
- Lobby is W.I.P (cannot change slot properties, but can join and can talk)
- Cannot provide map downloads
- Games cannot start
- Everyone has access to all commands

# Installation
I just said it's not functional why do you want it...

# Libraries & Credit
Using `DotNetZip`, `MpqTool` and `Nito.KitchenSink.CRC`
