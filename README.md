# Banshee
A Warcraft 3 Game emulator, inspired by GHost++, Made in C#. Pretty Simple

# Current State
- Lobby is W.I.P (cannot change slot properties, but can join and can talk)
- Cannot provide map downloads
- Games cannot start
- Everyone has access to all commands

# Installation
Honestly, i dont even know how i managed it. 
All i can do to lead you in the right direction is : install dotnet core, and try `dotnet publish` or `dotnet build` on your OS, it might work, it might not. It's worked for me for the most part.

# Libraries & Credit
Using `DotNetZip`, `MpqTool` and `Nito.KitchenSink.CRC`
